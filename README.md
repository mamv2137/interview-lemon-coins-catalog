# Cryptocurrencies List ðŸ“–

The exercise consists of making a list of cryptocurrencies that can be filtered by favorites, adding items to a list of favorites and being able to persist the favorites items.

Using a public API, for this I used the [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Introduction).

## Run the project

- First of all, install deps with `npm install`
- After that, run the metro command `npm run start`
- if you want to run the android app use `npm run android`
- otherwise if you want to run iOS app use `npm run ios`
